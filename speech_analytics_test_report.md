# Speech Analytics Feature Test Report
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Test Tool:** Playwright (Python)
**Test URL:** http://localhost:8765

---

## Test Summary

**Status:** FAILED (Configuration Issue Identified)

The Speech Analytics feature UI is working correctly, but there is a **configuration issue** preventing API calls from succeeding.

---

## Test Steps Executed

### Steps Completed Successfully:
1. ✅ Navigated to http://localhost:8765
2. ✅ Entered password "Paneas@321"
3. ✅ Clicked on "Playground" in navbar
4. ✅ Clicked on "Analytics" tab
5. ✅ Pasted test transcript into the transcript field
6. ✅ Verified "Sentimento" and "Emoção" checkboxes are checked
7. ✅ Clicked "Analisar" button

### Issue Encountered:
8. ❌ API request failed with HTTP 501 error

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem:
The frontend is being served by a **simple Python HTTP server** on port 8765:
```
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

This server **only supports GET requests** and returns `501 (Not Implemented)` for POST requests.

### The Architecture:
- **Frontend Server:** http://localhost:8765 (Python HTTP server - GET only)
- **API Server:** http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI - full REST API)

### What Happened:
1. User accessed the frontend at `http://localhost:8765`
2. The JavaScript `resolveApiBase()` function defaulted to `window.location.origin` = `http://localhost:8765`
3. When clicking "Analisar", the frontend tried to POST to `http://localhost:8765/api/v1/analytics/save-transcript`
4. The Python HTTP server returned `501 (Unsupported method 'POST')`

---

## Error Details

### Console Error:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 501 (Unsupported method ('POST'))
```

### Network Error:
```
POST http://localhost:8765/api/v1/analytics/save-transcript
Status: 501 (Unsupported method ('POST'))
```

### JavaScript Error:
```javascript
Analytics error: Error: Falha ao salvar transcrição
    at handleAnalyticsSubmit (http://localhost:8765/app.js:2275:37)
    at async HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (http://localhost:8765/app.js:1705:9)
```

### UI Error Message:
```
❌ Erro: Falha ao salvar transcrição
```

---

## Solution

### Option 1: Configure API Base URL in the UI (Recommended for Users)
The frontend has an "API Base URL" configuration field that needs to be set:

1. In the Playground section, scroll to the "Configuração" card
2. Set "API Base URL" to: `http://localhost:8000`
3. Click save/apply
4. Retry the Analytics operation

### Option 2: Serve Frontend via Nginx/FastAPI Static Files (Production)
For production deployment, the frontend should be served either:
- Via Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Via FastAPI's StaticFiles mounted on the same port as the API
- This ensures all requests go to the same origin

### Option 3: Update Frontend Default (Developer)
Modify the `resolveApiBase()` function to default to `http://localhost:8000` instead of `window.location.origin` for local development.

## Test Transcript Used

```
Operador: Bom dia, como posso ajudar? Cliente: Quero cancelar meu plano. Operador: Entendo, posso saber o motivo?
```

---

## Verified Working Components

✅ **Frontend UI:**
- Password authentication screen
- Navigation to Playground
- Tab switching (Real-time, Transcrição, OCR, etc.)
- Analytics tab UI
- File upload field (audio)
- Transcript textarea
- Checkbox controls (Sentimento, Emoção, Intenção, etc.)
- "Analisar" button

✅ **Backend API Endpoints (verified on port 8000):**
- `/api/v1/analytics/save-transcript` - EXISTS
- `/api/v1/analytics/upload-audio` - EXISTS
- `/api/v1/analytics/speech` - EXISTS
- `/api/v1/analytics/speech/{job_id}` - EXISTS

The API endpoints are properly implemented and included in the router.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action:
1. Update user documentation to specify setting API Base URL to `http://localhost:8000`
2. OR: Stop using `python3 -m http.server` and serve frontend through FastAPI/Nginx

### Code Improvements:
1. Add environment variable or config file for API_BASE_URL
2. Display clearer error messages when API base is misconfigured
3. Add API health check on page load to validate configuration
4. Consider CORS configuration if frontend and API are on different origins

### Testing:
The Speech Analytics backend appears to be correctly implemented. Once the API Base URL is properly configured, the feature should work as expected.

## Next Steps

To complete the test:
1. Configure API Base URL to `http://localhost:8000` in the UI
2. Re-run the test with updated configuration
3. Verify that:
   - Transcript is saved successfully
   - Analytics job is submitted
   - Results are polled and displayed
   - Sentiment, Emotion, and Intent analysis appear in the UI
